TheatreCMS, The Performing Arts Plugin, lite version. Manage your organization's events and production history.

== Description ==

Get a jump start developing your performing arts website with TheatreCMS. Whether you're a theater, orchestra, opera, concert venue, or any kind of producing organization, you can easily manage productions, events, and artists and display them on your site with no extra coding.

Full version available at http://www.theatrecms.com)

ORGANIZE YOUR PRODUCTIONS
Create a production that contains all the information about the run of a show; then create individuals events for your calendar. Organize your productions and presentations by season, venue, category, series, genre and more. View upcoming events easily in your WordPress dashboard. Instantly create biography pages for your artists by tagging productions and photos.

SEASON AND EVENT LISTS
Add season and event lists anywhere on our site with simple WordPress shortcodes. Ticketing buttons are built-in. (Calendars and accessibility symbols are available in the full version.)

WORKS WITH MAJOR TICKETING SYSTEMS
TheatreCMS doesn't replace your existing ticketing system: it works alongside it. Enter the URL for your box office, and the ticketing button appears on performances automatically.

BUILT FOR WORDPRESS
Extends the built-in functionality of WordPress for complete compatibililty. Uses custom post types, custom taxonomies, and custom fields with no extra database tables.
